                 Installing Stardust (Version 0.5, 2013-04-11)

   This is not trivial, because Stardust depends on other software to
   solve the constraints generated by typechecking indexed types.

Step 1: Install a constraint solver

   Currently, the only supported constraint solver is [1]CVC4.

   Stardust has been (lightly) tested with [2]CVC4 1.1, which you can
   download from NYU:
     * [3]Mac OS X installer package (.mpkg)
     * [4]Mac OS X, via macports
     * [5]Linux binary (mv cvc4-1.1-x86_64-linux-opt cvc4 ; chmod u+x cvc4
       ; sudo mv cvc4 /usr/local/bin)
     * [6]Debian Linux packages
     * [7]Linux or OS X: Build from source (.tar.gz file)

Step 2: Install a Standard ML compiler

   Stardust should compile under any recent version of [8]SML of New
   Jersey; I use [9]110.74.

   It also compiles under [10]MLton version 20100608 (probably other
   versions, too).

   MLton will generate a standalone Stardust executable that does not
   require an SML compiler to run, but you still need an SML compiler to
   compile the .stardust.sml file generated by Stardust.

Step 3: Build Stardust

   Enter the src subdirectory:

     cd src

  Using SML/NJ

   From the src subdirectory, type

     make nj

   to build under SML/NJ. This will generate a "heap image" and a script
   called stardust-nj, which invokes SML/NJ on the heap image.

  Using MLton

   From the src subdirectory, type

     make mlton

   to build under MLton, producing an executable called stardust.

Step 4: Try Stardust

   To check the installation, run one of the examples in the
   [11]subdirectory:

     ./stardust-nj kennedy11
     ./stardust kennedy11

   or equivalently,

     ./stardust-nj ../examples/kennedy11.sdml
     ./stardust ../examples/kennedy11.sdml

   (If you give a filename without the .sdml extension, Stardust adds
   .sdml and looks for the file in examples. If you give the .sdml
   extension, Stardust interprets it as an ordinary pathname.)
